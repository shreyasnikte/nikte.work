# Hello World

Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is where I'll share thoughts on things I find interesting.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- **Technical deep-dives** — Breaking down complex problems I've solved
- **Project updates** — Progress on things I'm building
- **Learning notes** — Things I'm exploring and experimenting with

## Another attempt

I tried blogging before. I abandoned the efforts after a while as life happened. Ultimately, erasing the entire blog. This time it is different: I might not write consistently this time around. But this blog will stay.
