# Hello World

Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is where I'll share thoughts on software development, technology, and things I find interesting.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- **Technical deep-dives** — Breaking down complex problems I've solved
- **Project updates** — Progress on things I'm building
- **Learning notes** — Things I'm exploring and experimenting with

## Why blog?

Writing helps me think. It forces clarity. If I can't explain something simply, I probably don't understand it well enough.

Stay tuned for more.

```bash
$ echo "Thanks for reading"
Thanks for reading
```
